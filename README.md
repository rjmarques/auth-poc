User Authentication &amp; Authorization PoC

## Keycloak

Perhaps the more interesting part is in: https://github.com/rjmarques/auth-poc/tree/master/keycloak/auth.

It has one middleware that does active checking of the session, and one that does passive checking.

Steps to run the PoC:

```
git clone https://github.com/rjmarques/auth-poc.git
cd auth-poc/keycloack

# start up keycloak and the example apps
docker-compose up --build -d keycloak webapp1 webapp2

# create all the clients, users, roles on keycloak
./startup.sh
```

Keycloak’s admin console can be accessed on http://localhost:8080/ and using `admin / admin`.

You also have 3 users (all with different groups and roles):

```
ric / ric
gary / gary
jimmy / jimmy
```

You can login with these on either:

```
http://localhost:8000/
http://localhost:9000/
```

The apps have single-sign-on, even tho it’s a different server on each port, since the browser sends the cookies for that domain and each server then asks keycloak if it’s valid. So this approach can be thought of “active validation” of sessions.
I’ve not implemented logout yet so it’s easier to use the browser’s incognito mode if you want to try and log in with different users.

There’s a secondary validation approach “passive validation” that I’ve also implemented on yet another app:

```
docker-compose up --build -d api
```

This one is uses port `:9999` but does not provide a webUI (it’s meant to behave a bit like STS) and is REST api only. To use you can do for example:

```
curl 'http://localhost:9999/login' -H 'content-type: application/json' --data-raw '{"username": "jimmy", "password": "jimmy"}'

# grab the token and do

curl 'http://localhost:9999/api/data' -H "Authorization: Bearer my_big_token"
```

Here the second request’s session is validated locally without interacting with keycloak.
